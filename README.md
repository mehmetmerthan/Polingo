# Language Learning Mobile Application

This app is AI powered and designed to help users enhance their language skills through various interactive features. 

## Features

The application includes six main sections, each designed to provide a unique learning experience:

### Home Page
- The home page prompts users with the 5,000 most commonly used English words from Oxford, guiding them to add these words to their personal dictionary based on their familiarity.
- Additionally, users will see a **Quote of the Day** along with the author's name, providing daily inspiration and motivation.

### 2. Reading List
- Users can select from a list of websites or choose a direct link to Google to navigate to their desired site.
- The advantage of this feature is that when users long-press a word while browsing, its translation is displayed instantly, and they can learn more about it.
